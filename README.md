# Ferelix

Ferelix is a self-hosted media server, similar to Plex or Jellyfin. It allows you to organize, manage, and stream your personal media collection from your own server.

## Architecture

Ferelix is organized into two main subprojects:

- **[Server](./server)** - The backend API and media management engine built with Python
- **[Web](./web)** - The web dashboard and media player built with modern web technologies

## Getting Started

Refer to the individual README files in each subproject for setup and development instructions:

- Server setup: [server/README.md](./server/README.md)
- Web setup: [web/README.md](./web/README.md)
